Data Analytics Dashboard

**Project Description:**

I have developed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to analyze the revenue generated by a chain of hotels across different cities. The dashboard provides insights into various factors influencing revenue, including room type, day types, mode of booking, and more. Additionally, key performance indicators (KPIs) have been identified to measure the performance of the hotels:

1. **Revenue:** The total revenue generated by the hotel chain.
2. **Total Bookings:** The overall number of bookings made.
3. **Average Rating:** The average rating given by customers for their stay experience.
4. **Total Capacity:** The total number of available rooms in the hotels.
5. **Total Successful Bookings:** The number of bookings that were successfully completed.
6. **Occupancy %:** The percentage of rooms occupied out of the total capacity.
7. **Total Cancelled Bookings:** The total number of bookings that were cancelled.
8. **Cancellation Rate:** The percentage of bookings that were cancelled out of the total bookings made.

This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for hotel management to monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and customer satisfaction.
